# kings-reddit-bot
A reddit bot that streams submissions form reddit.com/r/Kings. Its job is to search for submissions made by other team fans that come to compliment the Sacramento Kings. The bot will find the fan's team name and reply with a comment that compliments that specific team. The bot currently does not run on a server and runs locally.
